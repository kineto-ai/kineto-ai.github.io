The contents of our pages were created with great care. However, we cannot guarantee the correctness, completeness and accuracy of the contents. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages according to Section 7 paragraph 1 of TMG. According to Sections 8 to 10 of TMG, as a service provider, we are not obligated to supervise transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances which indicate an illegal activity.

Obligations to remove or block the use of information according to general laws remain unaffected. Liability in this regard, however, is only possible from the time of knowledge of a concrete infringement. We will immediately remove these contents if we become aware of any such legal violations.

Our website contains links to external websites of third parties and on whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these third-party content. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking. However, a permanent control of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete indications of an infringement. If we become aware of any legal infringements, we will immediately remove such links.
