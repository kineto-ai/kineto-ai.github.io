## NVIDIA DLI Building AI Agents with Multimodal Models

## About this Course

Learn how to build neural network agents that reason across multiple data types using advanced fusion techniques, OCR, and NVIDIA AI Blueprints for real-world applications like robotics and video search and summarization.

***

## Learning Objectives

In this course, you will learn about:
- Different data types and how to make them neural network ready
- Model fusion, and the differences between early, late, and intermediate fusion
- PDF extraction using OCR
- The difference between modality and agent orchestration
- Customization of NVIDIA AI Blueprints with Video Search and Summarization (VSS)

***

## Topics Covered

- Begin with a robotics use case to show how different datatypes impact an effective neural-networks architecture.
- Apply mathematical concepts from robotics to Large Language Models (LLMs) to modify them for non-language data input.
- End with orchestration of multiple models to answer user queries.

***

## Course Outline

1. **Early and Late Fusion** (1 hr)  
   - Use camera and LiDAR data to predict object positions.  
   - Convert various datatypes to make them neural network ready.

2. **Intermediate Fusion** (1 hr)  
   - Explore the theory behind effective multimodal model architecture.  
   - Train a Contrastive Pretraining model.  
   - Create a vector database.

3. **Cross-modal Projection** (2 hr)  
   - Convert a Language model into a Vision Language Model (VLM).  
   - Process PDFs with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools.

4. **Model Orchestration** (2 hr)  
   - Analyze video using Cosmos Nemotron.  
   - Use VSS to answer user queries about video content.  
   - Orchestrate with NVIDIA AI Blueprints.

5. **Assessment** (1 hr)  
   - Convert a pre-trained model to input a different datatype using projection.
